        "summary": "When I’m not working on my own geeky projects (usually around home automation) I’m mostly found spending time with my family. I’m used to being on call with work, but with the RFS, when the pager goes off it’s a rush down to the firestation to jump on the firetruck or fire boat and help out with a fire, car accident or other incident. When I get the opportunity I’ll don my full pirate regalia, grab my cutlass, head to harbor and jump on the nearest tall ship for another sailing adventure! Yarr! "
